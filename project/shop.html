      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>iShop is a web application for an online store where users can shop and sell thousand products without have to leave their home offices. </p>

      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      iShop is an improvement/continuation of my web development class final project. For the final presentation, I created a website illustrated the CRUD. After the class ended, I have extended this simple website to a mini version of AMAZON where customers can find various products. This project was inspired by the gigatic ecommerce: AMAZON. 

      <h3>DESIGN PROCESS </h3>
      <ol>
        <li><h5>Prototyping:</h5>
          <p>I have decided to design my website by hand sketch. It doesn't look great, but it is a really quick way for me to prototype my commercial  store. Here are my iShop should look like:   </p>
          <p>include image of sketches here ! </p>
         </li>
        <li><h5>Database Design:</h5></li>
		<p> screenshots of database tables </p>
		<p>I used MySQL database on MySQL workbench. PHP was used to make a SQL statement call to retrieve data from the database. There are 3 tables in the SHOP schema: USER, PRODUCT, CATEGORY. USER table stores all information relative to each user including: email address, password, name, type of users, and address. The PRODUCT table stores all information about the listed product by sellers. It includes, product name, product listed price, quantity, and category. Here are the structures of each table:  </p>
        <li><h5>Flowchart: process of the site</h5></li>

      </ol>

      <h3>IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
      <h6>Tools: Web browser, DBMS: mysql workbench, MAMP, Bootstrap framework</h6>
      <h6>Language: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL</h6>

      <p>image of the final product is here </p>
      <p class="project-step">Homepage</p>
      <p>It is the shop main page where all products will be listed. It is accessible by all users with/witout login.</p>
      <p class="project-step">Login</p>
      <p>Without login, user can still view all listed products in the main homepage. By login as a customer, user can view all the listed products and purchase them, they can also view, edit their carts. After a sucessful login, the seller can list their new products or edit/delete their existing products. </p>
      <p class="project-step">SignUp</p>
      <p>There are two types of user that can be signed for: seller or customer account</p>
      <p class="project-step">User Profile</p>
	  <p>This feature is available to both type of users. They can edit their profile information.<p>
      <p class="project-step">Add/Edit Product Page:</p>
	  <p>This feature is only accessible to the seller. This user can add, make change, and delete the product. </p>
      <p class="project-step">Shopping Cart</p>
      <p>Shopping Cart Page: can be only acessilbe by the customer account. <i>Not YImplemented yet</p>

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
	  <p>Before finishing this personal project, I have a very minimal knowledge of how to build an informative website using the database. I wasn't sure how to create a table and write sql statement to retrieve all those data from the database and display them on a website. After completing this project, I have learned a lot of how to build a dynamic website. In addition, I have gained more confident in web design programming skill as well as debuging skill. </p>
